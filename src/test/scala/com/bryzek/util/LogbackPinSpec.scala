/** The logback version this build resolves is pinned in build.sbt rather than inherited, and a pin
  * that stops applying is silent everywhere else: an affected jar resolves cleanly and every logger
  * in the build goes on working.
  *
  * `HardenedObjectInputStream` is what logback deserializes a socket-delivered logging event
  * through, and through 1.5.32 it decided what such an event may instantiate by PREFIX: a class
  * name beginning `java.lang` or `java.util` was admitted whatever class it actually named, so
  * anything able to reach a `SimpleSocketServer` or `SimpleSSLSocketServer` could choose freely
  * from those two packages (GHSA-p47f-322f-whfh). From 1.5.33 the same decision is an equality test
  * against sixteen named classes plus whatever whitelist the caller supplied.
  *
  * 1.5.33 is also where those constructors began taking a `Context`, so this file does not compile
  * against an affected version at all and a slipped pin surfaces as a build error rather than as a
  * red test. What the assertions add is that the class on the classpath BEHAVES as the fixed one
  * rather than merely carrying its signature. Both are needed: a check that asked only for the
  * refusal would pass just as well on a jar that had stopped deserializing anything at all.
